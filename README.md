Color Guessing Game - JavaScript Practice

This project is a simple color guessing game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates proficiency in:

    DOM manipulation: The code effectively retrieves and modifies elements like squares, buttons, and text displays using JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) API.
    Event listeners: The game utilizes event listeners to capture user interactions with buttons and color squares, triggering appropriate functionality based on clicks.
    Random color generation: The script generates random RGB color values using Math functions and creates arrays to store them.
    Conditional logic: The code employs conditional statements to check for user choices (difficulty selection and color clicks) and update the game state accordingly.
    JavaScript functions: The logic is organized into well-defined functions for initialization, setting up buttons and squares, handling resets, and core game mechanics.
    Basic styling with CSS: An external CSS file (not included here) is likely used to style the game's visual elements like buttons, squares, and text displays.

This project highlights my ability to grasp fundamental web development concepts and implement them in a practical, interactive application. It showcases my understanding of core JavaScript functionalities and serves as a stepping stone towards building more complex web-based projects.

Further Enhancements:

    Implement a timer for challenging players to guess the color within a time limit.
    Add more difficulty levels with varying numbers of color options.
    Include a color palette selection mode where players can choose their own color sets.
    Improve the visual design using CSS for a more polished look and feel.
